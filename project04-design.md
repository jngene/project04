## Layout

I designed a layout that was **minimal, clean, and simple to read and navigate**. Since the premise for the website is for first time players of the boardgame, having **clear and bold headings** plus **highlighting important information** would be the way to go.

There's a quick z-pattern for the information in the beginning with the **game's key facts** such as number of players, setup time, and playing time at the **terminal area** since that is the most valuable information.

The rest of the website also follows a loose z-pattern by alternating the text and image aligments to:

* helps to **visually break up** large chunks of information
* explicitly show viewers when they are **reading separate headings/bodies of inforation**
* **provides an interesting flow** for the eyes to follow so they don't get bored by reading everything in one continous column



## Color pallette

With the website, there are the base colors of: 

- **black** text on a **white** background
- default accent color of **salmon pink** - color works seamlessly with almost any accent color of the boardgames

The accent on the headings of each page **depends on the main color of the boardgame icon**. I believe this:

- helps give each page its **own identity**
- would act as a **secondary visual cue** to the person viweing the page that they are reading about the correct boardgame



## Typography

The two fonts I chose for this website were **Poppins** and **Source Sans Pro**. I wanted the website to have a **modern** feel and both of the fonts chosen are **sans serif fonts** which are seen in modern websites. 

The fonts also: 

- provide a **clean** feel to the website
- makes the information present look **less cluttered**
- chose a **playful typeface** like Poppins as the primary typeface (roundness of typeface provides a **playful and open demenour**) - people tend to be playful when playing boardgames
