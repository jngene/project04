## Choreography

### Order of Board Games

Board games should be ordered by date of publicaiton, with the oldest games first and the newest games last. Older games tend to be more well-known and familar with wider ranges of people. This is useful to the user as they can access older, more familar games first.

### Order of Content

For each board game, an overview of key facts should be at the top of the page to give key information to the user. 

Subheadings should be organized from "Gameplay" to "Strategy" to "Popular variations" as if the user was being introduced to the game for the first time in person. When first introduced to a game in person, that player would first be told the rules of the game and how a winner is determined. After, they understand the basic princples a player would then be introduced to or develop strategies for how to maximze their chances of winning. Lastly, after becoming familar with a game a player would then be curious or introduced to other styles or ways of playing the board game. 

A photo should be placed below the sub-heading for which is belongs.
